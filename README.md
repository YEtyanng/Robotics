Attempting to implement an automatically tracking car in CoppeliaSim, a simulation software commonly used for robot simulations.


Before you try to use this code, you might need to know how to use zmqApi to control the cart in coppeliasim. After your python IDE link to Coppleliasim successfully, replace the main.py in your project with the main.py from the current project to see the implemented results.
